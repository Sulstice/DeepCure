###### Section 1: Virtual Docking

**Background**: To improve the accuracy and consistency of current virtual docking algorithms,
we are developing DeepDockR, a machine learning powered docking platform. Achieving that
requires us to dock thousands of molecules into a target of interest and store all associated
scores and metadata in our database. While we have automated much of the docking pipeline,
a very important step is the choice and preparation of the structures to use for docking.

**Goal**: Evaluate the performance of a docking software in estimating the binding affinity of
compounds to Carbonic Anhydrase I, by comparing the virtual docking results to available
bioactivity data. The evaluation should comprise of regression and as well as ranking metrics.
